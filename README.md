# Cavlog â€“ Business (Barber App)
 
# Project Overview:
Cavlog Business is the dedicated barber panel of the Cavlog ecosystem, developed to empower barbers with full control over their appointments, services, and customer engagement. Built using Flutter and Firebase, the app combines smart scheduling with a real-time social experience, allowing barbers to manage their bookings and showcase their work through posts and reels.
The platform offers manual and automatic slot generation, custom service pricing, and dynamic availability control. Barbers can track their earnings through detailed revenue analyticsâ€”visualized across daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly chartsâ€”and monitor booking history for deeper insights. It transforms traditional salon operations into a streamlined, interactive, and data-driven mobile experience.
